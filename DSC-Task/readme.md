## DSC Task
This is a task given in by DSC Team. The site is made with pure HTML and CSS. I have tried to use every possible topic that I can cover in given period of time.
The files contain navigation bar, cards, carousel, content box and much more. I have also included butten howering effects and tried to make site as identical as the given one.
Bootstrap is also included to show my working with it and also because of limited time. I have also tried to include responsiveness to site (in heading and navigation bar) but 
coudn't implement it well in given time period. 

## Enhancements
There are lot of changes that can be made to this really cool looking site and I will try to implement them at some time in future. I wil also try to use Javascript which I tried to
add this time. I found this site well designed particularly for a club purpose and so will be my strategy to enhance it.
